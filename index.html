      <p>In August 2024, MannaHelp organized a community-driven event in Whitby, Ontario, distributing 141 backpacks and over 1,400 pounds of food to families in need. The day was filled with activities, including barbecues, resume workshops, and heartfelt speeches from local leaders.

      <h2>Lagori’s Donation Drive in Mumbai</h2>
      <p>At the Aarna Foundation in Mumbai, volunteers from Lagori hand-packed and distributed school supplies to underprivileged children. The joy on the children’s faces as they received their new school bags was a testament to the difference such initiatives make. The event emphasized not just the provision of materials but also the importance of building relationships and instilling hope.</p>

      <h2>Why We Need You</h2>
      <p>Every day, brave men and women return home from service with wounds — some visible, many hidden.</p>
      <p>They gave everything for their country, but many now face a different kind of battle: injury, trauma, job loss, and feeling forgotten.</p>
      <p>We started this mission because we believe no soldier should ever have to fight alone.</p>
      <p>Your support doesn’t just give money — it gives mobility, medical care, hope, and a reminder that someone still cares.</p>
      <p>Whether it’s a wheelchair, a warm meal, or a phone call to say “we’ve got your back” — every dollar brings real change.</p>
      <p>This isn’t charity — it’s honor. And together, we can be the reason a hero gets the help they need.</p>
